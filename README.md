# planktonr

The goal of planktonr is to support counting plankton on a base plate. Analysts often donâ€™t want to count everything, as that will take ages. Rather, they aim to count as few things as possible without exceeding an acceptable amount of error. `planktonr` helps researchers determine such sample sizes.

## Installation

You can install planktonr from github with:


``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("annakrystalli/planktonr")
```

## Example

Launch the app by loading the package and running:

``` r
library(planktonr)
planktr_runApp()
```
